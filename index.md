My name is Supro, and I am a Senior Data Analyst working towards a masters in statistics at North Carolina State University. There are a lot of parallels with these classes and my day-to-day duties at my job, such as:

+ Utilizing SAS to filter out large sums of data.
+ Using R to visualize different pharmaceutical/drug trends.
+ Using various descriptive statistics methods to generate metrics for clients.
+ Using SQL to quickly partition data.


My undergrad years were spent at the University of Pittsburgh, where I took a lot of my Statistics classes in [`the Cathedral of Learning`](https://christianworldtraveler.wordpress.com/2011/09/26/cathedral-of-learning-a-good-pittsburgh-stop/). This building served as a hallmark on our campus, boasting 40 floors and a Harry Potter-like atmosphere on campus. 

If you would like to contact me regarding any of my past experiences with statistics, or what I currently do now, please email me at sdebnat@ncsu.edu!
